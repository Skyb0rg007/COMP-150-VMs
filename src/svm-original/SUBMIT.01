COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Skye Soss

Not counting code that was distributed to everyone, what code was
contributed by other persons or groups?  Who were the contributors?

  - The Lab portion - Mert Erden

What work are you proud of?

  - The implementation of `vmrun` using jump-tables, which is used in VMs like
    Ruby and Python to speed up the interpreter.

What code would you like help improving?

  - The code for the VMState, since code relies on some of the VM structure
    members having a specific structure (ex. registers being an array), so abstracting
    that into macros / inline functions would make refactoring easier.
    In addition, I do eventually want to modify the implementation of `Value`s, so
    abstracting all the helpers is very important (ex. never directly access struct fields).

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - The beginning of `vmrun`. I'm unsure what I could be reasonably caching outside of what I am currently.

For the first module, the instructor will present at a plenary code
review.

  - In your group, who is willing to serve on the review panel?
    Skye

  - What would you like the instructor to present at the code review?
    (Ideally, choose some distributed code that you don't understand
    or would like clarificationÂ on.)
