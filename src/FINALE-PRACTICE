COMP 150VM: Practice for the Course Finale

What group is reporting this finale practice?

  - Skye Soss, Geoff Hudson, Mert Erden

What feature did you choose?

  - Pattern-matching

What is your implementation plan?  Include answers to any questions
you addressed during lab.

  A. No. We add a new datatype as well.

  B. Erlang pattern-matching can be implemented as a syntax translation,
     converting patterns using the same variable twice into patterns with
     different variables, generating a guard pattern that asserts the
     variables are equal.

  C. The new feature can mostly be handled in the UFT.
     We propose to introduce four svm instructions:
     `con-new`, `con-id`, `con-get-at`, `con-set-at`.

  E. Everything down to (and including) knormal form.

  F. We plan on adding translation passes after the disambiguate pass

  I.
    1. Convert to guard lists
    2. Re-order guard lists and normalize variable naming
    3. Create decision tree
    4. Generate code
