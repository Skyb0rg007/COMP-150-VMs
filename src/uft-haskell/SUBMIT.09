COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Skye Soss

What work are you proud of?

  - None for this assignment

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - Understanding how to fit FO scheme into the translation.
    I've spent so much time trying to understand how to fit the FO scheme
    into the translation pass that I have no clue how to complete the project
    without completely redesigning every translation step from scratch.
    I don't know if I have enough free time to meaningfully complete these
    assignments on time because I have to write everything from scratch,
    so I can't apply for any of the testing-based project points.

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - N/A

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - Just the lab portion

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - No


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - No

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I don't think the presented code could help with what I'm struggling with

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - Yep!
