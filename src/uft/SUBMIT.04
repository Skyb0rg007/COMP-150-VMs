COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Skye Soss

What work are you proud of?

  - The label elimination

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - Bugs with object code generation

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - The unparsing, could likely be made much better

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - I completed the entire codebase myself.

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - No


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - I am, but I wrote my code in Prolog. I'm pretty sure you don't want to subject students to that.

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - Not sure what would be helpful because I deviated so much from the original stuff.

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - Me!
