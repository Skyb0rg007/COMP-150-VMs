COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Skye Soss

What work are you proud of?

  - My parsing code, since it uses Alex + Happy to generate a fast LR parser,
    while keeping track of location info so that I can hopefully add location-based
    error messages in the future.

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - The module structure. I use things like primitive names all over the codebase,
    and it may be better to have them as an enum in one place.

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - N/A

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - N/A

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - I changed from Prolog -> Haskell


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - No, I am not finished with my work

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - The KNormal algorithm

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - I can do it, but I've already done it before.
