COMP 150VM Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Skye Soss

What work are you proud of?

  - The variable renaming because Haskell does it in a single line

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - N/A. I'm currently working on a rewrite using compositional data structures
    inspired by Datatypes a la Carte

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - None

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - Nope

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - I started the rewrite after Norman said I should go all out with the Haskell stuff


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - I don't think that's a good idea considering how I program in Haskell

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - Most of my questions relate to how Norman's starter code was implemented,
    so I don't have many questions that can be reasonably answered.

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

- I can!
